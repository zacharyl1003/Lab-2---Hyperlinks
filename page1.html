<h1> What's is a Galaxy?</h1>
<P> A galaxy… well, it’s more than just stars and planets scattered in the night sky. 
It’s an enormous family:
<ul>
    <li>Suns</li>
    <li>Worlds</li>
    <li>Gas</li>
    <li>Dust</li>
</ul> 
These are all bound together by a mysterious force we call gravity. 
Our own home, the Milky Way, is just one of countless galaxies out there. When I was a farm boy staring up at the twin suns on Tatooine, I never imagined that our little system was just a tiny piece of something so much greater—millions of stars stretching farther than I could ever see.
But galaxies aren’t all the same. Some spin like giant spirals, their arms reaching out like starships caught in a dance, while others are more like glowing clouds with no clear shape.
Together they form clusters and superclusters, whole communities of worlds and civilizations. That’s the stage where stories like mine play out—where Empires rise, Rebels fight, and hope survives. 
A galaxy isn’t just stars and dust; it’s the canvas of adventure, destiny, and the Force that connects us all.</p>
