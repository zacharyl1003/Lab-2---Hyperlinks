<h1>What is Mass?</h1>

<p>
Mass! Oh, I do love mass—sounds boring, doesn’t it? “Mass.” But it’s not, it’s marvelous. Mass is what tells the universe, “Hello, I’m here, I matter!” It’s the amount of “stuff” something has—how much it resists being pushed about, how much space-time it bends around itself. That’s why when you give a football a good kick, it flies off easily, but try that with a planet and, well… bad idea, very sore foot. Mass is also the reason gravity happens. The more mass something has, the more it pulls everything else towards it. Tiny mass—tiny pull. Gigantic mass—super pull. That’s why the Sun keeps the Earth in orbit, why black holes are greedy little cosmic vacuum cleaners, and why even you bend space-time ever so slightly just by existing. So, mass isn’t just weight—it’s the universe’s way of measuring how much influence you’ve got in the great cosmic dance. Brilliant, isn’t it?
